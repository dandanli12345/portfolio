  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p>I graduated from Georgetown University with a master degree in law. After solving some problems using code,
  I started to recognize the beauty of programming. It's fascinating to see the website built with computer languages,
  or the problems solved effectively by the computer using just a couple lines of command.</p>
  
  <p>I intend to dive deeper into software engineering, where unique products can be created by like-minded engineers,
  combined with logical thinking as well as customized designs. So, don't hesitate to contact me if you share the
  same thoughts or you are looing for a software engineer. I would love to work with other engineers!</p>
