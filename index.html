  <h2>Hello!</h2>
  <p>I'm <b><i>Dandan Li</b></i>, a software engineer in Greenwich, Connecticut. </p>
  <p>A few things I like: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Web designs</li>
    <li>Solving different problems using code</li>
    <li>Playing sudoku</li>
    <li>Reading thrillers, memoirs</li>
  </ul>
  
  <br>
  
  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p>I graduated from Georgetown University with a master degree in law. After solving some problems using code,
  I started to recognize the beauty of programming. I's fascinating to see the website built with computer languages,
  or the problems solved effectively by the computer using just a couple lines of command.</p>
  
  <p>I intend to dive deeper into software engineering, where unique products can be created by like-minded engineers,
  combined with logical thinking as well as customized designs. So, don't hesitate to contact me if you share the
  same thoughts or you are looing for a software engineer. I would love to work with other engineers!</p>
